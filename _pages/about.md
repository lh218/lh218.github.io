<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Ph.D. Candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html)), Department of Computer Science and Engineering from 2022, advised by [Prof. Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~farnia/). I also collaborate with [Prof. Amin Gohari](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/gohari-amin/).

I graduated from Mathematics and Information Engineering, a double-major program jointly offered by the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html)), with a Bachelor's Degree in the Honor Class [ELITE Stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite). It's my pleasure to be kindly advised by [Prof. Chandra Nair](https://chandra.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) and [Prof. Anthony MC So](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/).

My research interests include **Trustworthy AI (Robustness, Fairness, and Interpretability)** and **Machine Learning Theory based on Optimization Theory and Information Theory**. I also seek relevant applications in LLMs and Multi-modal reasoning.

[On the Inductive Biases of Demographic Parity-based Fair Learning Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18129)

**Haoyu Lei**, Amin Gohari, Farzan Farnia 

[**Project**](https://github.com/lh218/Fairness-IB)
- We Theoretically show that Inductive Biases widely exist in DP-based fair supervised learning algorithms, and further propose a distributionally robust optimization framework to mitigate the biases.
