# <span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am now a Ph.D. Candidate at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html)), Department of Computer Science and Engineering from 2022, advised by [Prof. Farzan Farnia](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~farnia/).

I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Information Engineering, a double-major program jointly offered by the Department of Mathematics and the Department of Information Engineering at The Chinese University of Hong Kong ([CUHK](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html)), within the Honor Class [ELITE Stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite). It's my pleasure to be kindly advised by [Prof. Chandra Nair](https://chandra.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) and [Prof. Anthony MC So](https://www1.se.cuhk.edu.hk/~manchoso/).

My research interests include **Theory-based Trustworthy AI (Robustness, Fairness, and Interpretability)** and **Diffusion-based Generative Models**. I seek relevant applications in Computer Vision, Decision Making, and Planning.

*Boosting Generalization in Diffusion-Based Neural Combinatorial Solver via Energy-guided Sampling*

**Haoyu Lei**, Kaiwen Zhou, Yinchuan Li, Zhitang Chen, Farzan Farnia 

[**Paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12188)/[**Code**]
- We propose a general energy-guided sampling framework during inference time that enhances both the cross-scale and cross-problem generalization capabilities of diffusion-based NCO solvers without requiring additional training.

*Boosting the visual interpretability of CLIP via adversarial fine-tuning*

Shizhan Gong, **Haoyu Lei**, Qi Dou, Farzan Farnia 

[**Paper**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=khuIvzxPRp)/[**Code**]
- We propose an unsupervised adversarial fine-tuning (AFT) with norm-regularization to enhance the visual interpretability of CLIP.

*On the Inductive Biases of Demographic Parity-based Fair Learning Algorithms*

**Haoyu Lei**, Amin Gohari, Farzan Farnia 

[**Paper**](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=r1t2m5IDVV)/[**Code**](https://github.com/lh218/Fairness-IB)
- We theoretically show that Inductive Biases widely exist in DP-based fair supervised learning algorithms, and further propose a distributionally robust optimization framework to mitigate the biases.

*An Efficient Alternating Direction Method For Graph Learning From Smooth Signals*

Xiaolu Wang, Chaorui Yao, **Haoyu Lei**, Anthony Man-Cho So

[**Paper**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9414791)
- We cast the graph learning formulation as a nonsmooth, strictly convex optimization problem and develop an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to solve it.
